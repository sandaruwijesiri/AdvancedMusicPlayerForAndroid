# AdvancedMusicPlayerForAndroid
This is an advanced music player application for Android that can fetch song metadata using the Shazam API provided through rapidapi.com, scans raw audio in order to normalize volume at playback and order songs in queue based on the properties of the audio instead of random shuffling. 

To install the .apk file, enable the “Allow unknown sources” option in the settings of the device.
